How it works?

After map-formation, individual tiles (Bricks) look around in four directions for neighbouring Bricks and tries to form Units with them.
Units stay together for the rest of the game.
After Unit-formation a Unit gets selected randomly and its members ask to vote for moving or staying. If they vote to move, they re-vote for the direction of movement. Finally the Unit moves (if the movement is possible) and another Unit is selected...



How to use it?

First set the Filling level with the slider.
Then generate a map.
Form initial Units.
Press moveUnits.

Control the moving willingness with the X slider.
Control the required direction agreement precentige with the Y slider.
Control the extra vote Bricks get that wanted to move in the first place.

'Generated Units' meter shows the number of individual Units currently on the map.
'Total Unit Moves' shown the number of actual movements Units made so far
'Moving precentige' shows the ratio between the total possible movements and actual movements Units made

Ideas; 

- add pickup that would change the tiles want to prefer a direction (set, like up/down/etc, OR away/to the player's location)
- add functionality to Unit reFormation (Join/Split Units)
/ they can "prefer" to join smaller/bigger/no prefference Units
/ there will be a precentage for Join or not (one random no (on slider) for the whol Unit)
/ Bricks vote to separate themselfs form their Units (and may join aother one if it's 1 tile away) (value on slider)
